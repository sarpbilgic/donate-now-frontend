Create a high-conversion charity landing page using Next.js 15, Tailwind, and Framer Motion.

Layout & Vibe:

Background: Dark theme with a glowing, animated 'Aurora Borealis' effect in the center.

Hero Section (Center Stage):

A massive, animated number displaying 'Total Raised' (e.g., $12,450). Use a count-up animation.

Directly below it: A prominent, glowing 'Make a Difference' button that triggers a donation modal.

Footer Ticker: A smooth, infinite horizontal scrolling marquee at the bottom showing 'Recent Donations' (e.g., 'Anonymous donated $25 • Sarp donated $50').

Functionality:

The Total Counter and Recent Ticker should be visible to everyone (no login required).

Donation Modal (Dialog):

Step 1: Select Amount ($10, $25, $50, Custom).

Step 2 (Conditional): If user is not logged in, show a placeholder for an Auth form.

Step 3: Credit Card form placeholder.

Use Shadcn/ui components. Make it look trustworthy but futuristic.
